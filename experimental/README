This directory contains the ECG patch code together drivers/code for additional 
sensors e.g. Accelerometer.
project/ECG/ contains drivers for internal and external ADC.
external ADC is same as the one present in stable version that interfaces the ADC7705
over the SPI bus. Internal ADC driver is the ADC driver present for Atmage2181 internal
ADC modified to work in interrupt mode and process accelerometer (adxl330) data only.
