This directory contains the stable and minimal version of ECG patch 
over Nano-RK CMU firefly platform. 

nano-RK/projects/ECG  - contains the code that runs the ECG patch that 
reads data from the ECG leeds using ADC driver over SPI bus at 100Hz and 
sends it over RF using BMAC. 

nano-RK/projects/ECG_rx - contains the reception code that runs the ECG gateway 
connected to the PC.  This code reads RF data using BMAC and sends it to the 
PC over UART.
